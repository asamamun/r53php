    <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>MySQL supports a variety of storage engines, which are components that handle the storage and retrieval of data in a MySQL database. Some of the most commonly used storage engines in MySQL include:</p><ul><li><p>InnoDB: This is the default storage engine for MySQL as of version 5.5. It is a transaction-safe (ACID compliant) storage engine with support for row-level locking, foreign keys, and crash recovery.</p></li><li><p>MyISAM: This is the default storage engine for MySQL prior to version 5.5. It is a non-transactional storage engine that is known for its high performance and small footprint.</p></li><li><p>Memory: This storage engine stores all data in memory, which makes it very fast, but also means that all data is lost when the server is shut down.</p></li><li><p>CSV: This storage engine stores data in CSV (comma-separated values) format, which allows for easy integration with other applications that support that format.</p></li><li><p>Archive: This storage engine is optimized for storing large amounts of historical data, with a focus on minimal disk space usage and fast data retrieval.</p></li><li><p>Blackhole: This storage engine acts as a "black hole" into which data can be inserted, but not retrieved.</p></li><li><p>Federated: This storage engine allows tables to be created on remote servers, and accessed as if they were local.</p></li><li><p>Merge: This storage engine allows multiple MyISAM tables to be combined and treated as a single table.</p></li><li><p>Example: This storage engine is used for example and test purposes, and it does not implement any storage.</p></li></ul><p>Each storage engine has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best one to use will depend on the specific requirements of your application.</p></div>
